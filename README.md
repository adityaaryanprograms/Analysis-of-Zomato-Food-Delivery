# Analysis of Zomato Food Delivery

## Problem Statement
Newly started Bengaluru restaurants are having difficulty in competing with established restaurants. They are not able to decide the cost that would happen per 2 people for once. Due to offline orders, Zomato is not able to attract customers with diverse items and offers, and the user subscription is also getting low. We can use supervised learning to estimate restaurant costs and identify patterns which decide the type of orders.

## Description
There are 51,717 records and a total of 17 columns in the data. 2 of the numerical columns had symbols, spaces etc. which made them have an object data type initially and thus such records were removed and the columns were converted into float datatype. Regression, classification and clustering techniques were used for the predictions and actionable findings.

## Outcome
Predicted cost for 2 people and type of order (online/offline) with good accuracy. Also found various factors which lead to change in order type.

## Key Skills Used
Pandas, Pre-processing, Variable Analysis, Encoding, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Classification, Clustering
